# Task 1: Keyword Highlighter
# Write a program that searches through a series of 
# product reviews for keywords such as "good", "excellent", 
# "bad", "poor", and "average". Print out each review with 
# the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.

    for keyword in words:
        review = review.replace(keyword, keyword.upper())
    
    return review

# Task 2: Sentiment Tally
# Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and 
# negative words in each review. Use a predefined list of positive 
# and negative words to check against. The function should return 
# the count of positive and negative words for each review.

# Task 3: Review Summary
# Implement a script that takes the first 50 characters of 
# a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. Ensure that 
# the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.
